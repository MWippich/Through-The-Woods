# 1 "Intro"

## Interaction

Dusk skybox & lightning - brighter than the night scene which is the default. no weather

The player will be outside the fence gate, which is closed. There's a sign which indicates that you have to close your eyes. When getting closer you start hearing whispers which get louder as you get closer. When you keep your eyes closed, you hear a voice with some instructions and story. After which you hear a creaking from the gate opening and the skybox and lightning turns to the default night. After going through the gate, the next blink will close the gate shut and it is now locked. 

## Voicelines

"Keep your eyes closed and listen... bla bla, enter at your own risk... (creaking from fence)"

# 2 Statue

whispers from the toolshed pointing to the statue.

## Interaction

A puzzle. You need to find the three colored cubes scattered acress the scene and place them approprately.

Reward: Clicking sound, indicating the tool shed is now open. from now on, creaking sound indicating the shed is open. 
Whispers from tool shed stop.

# 2 Tool shed

The shed is empty, but there are whispers. Close your eyes, *evil laughter* while inside, rain and thunder will start and the scewne will get significantly darker. There is a lantern inside the shed. Now the shed is full of stuff (including the necessary item for well). Need to rifle through everything, to find the item missing from the well (TBD). 

Idea: It glows strangely, when looking at in your periphery. 

Reward: can now repair well. Whispers from the well stop (while holding the item, they will stop permanently when the well is repaired).

# 3 Well

Repair the well by holding the item close to the well. Now you can use the winch/crank, to pull up the bucket.

Perhaps: Whispers from the well that you can wind the bucket up - appears after maybe 10s?

Reward: In the bucket is the key to the cabin.

# 4 End

With the key in one hand you can unlock the door, by holding your hand close. The door swings open (sound appreciated), and you can enter...
